## General-Relativity-on-Black-Holes

The GRB Jet Energy Model is a program that attempts to analyze the approximate energy levels of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) during different time periods. We post our analysis of the numerical simulation as well as our research in order to support further development of the jet energy & energy per solid angle models in the future.

## Program Configurations and Concepts

In order to provide a scientifically accurate program, the repository is based off of a detailed roadmap for the project, consisting of critical concepts and formulas that are needed in the MHD black hole simulation. The configurations and concepts used for the project is linked here: [General Relativity Black Hole Project Concepts and Configurations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ub_sB_Nl0maIpdlDiENRfyxAHq2ZUGGY/view?usp=sharing). **This PDF is still being updated with more content in future commits.**
